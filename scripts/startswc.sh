# This script starts the swc weblogic server. It merely calls the startswc$ENVIRONMENT.sh script in /xpedx/wldomain/xp$ENVIRONMENT/
# You can use this script to start swc without having to worry about which environment it's being executed on. 
#Note: The agent servers don't really have weblogic installed. so the script will never really get called on any of them.
