# This script starts the smcfs weblogic server. It merely calls the startsmcfs$ENVIRONMENT.sh script in /xpedx/wldomain/xp$ENVIRONMENT/
# You can use this script to start smcfs without having to worry about which environment it's being executed on. 
#Note: The agent servers don't really have weblogic installed. so the script will never really get called on any of them.
