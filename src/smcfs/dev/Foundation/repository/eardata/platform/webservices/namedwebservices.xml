<!-- This XML will be filled in by the user at deployment time of the
Sterling application. The desired services are to be added as named webservices.
 The ServiceName attribute is the name of the
service that the user has configured within the Sterling Service Builder.
The ExposedName attribute is the name that will be used in the wsdl.
This is the name that a webservice caller will use to programmatically
the webservice
The User can optionally expose only certain apis by specifing the api names
under the Apis Node.  If the user wants to expose all the apis the 
ExposeAllAPIs attribute should be set to "Y"

NOTE:  For WebSphere, there is a strict requirement that all exposed
webservices must start with a lower case letter.
